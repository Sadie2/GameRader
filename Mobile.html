      <h3 class="card-title">The Artful Escape Review:</h3>
      <h5>Paint the town shred</h5>
      <p class = "card-text">At last there’s a new Guitar Hero game, only this one doesn’t require you to dust off the pile of plastic peripherals you’ve long since stashed on a shelf in your garage. A musical voyage of personal discovery for its axe-wielding star, Francis Vendetti, The Artful Escape is a story-driven platforming adventure that weaves in light rhythm game mechanics as you blaze fiery riffs through cosmic rifts across the universe and back again. Inspired intergalactic environments, a charmingly quirky cast, and some sparklingly grandiose guitarwork propel The Artful Escape into what becomes a genuinely magical mystery tour.</p>

      <h3 class="card-title">Monoument Valley 2</h3>
      <h5>My brain is being tricked into believing impossibilities.</h5>
      <p class = "card-text">The games structure is much the same as the 2014 original. I regard an isometric world of blocks, stairs, doors and elevators. I touch the screen to move a character called Ro along pathways, until she comes across an obstacle. I manipulate clearly signaled artifacts in order to aid her progression. One puzzle leads to another, in which I operate screws and hoists in order to create pathways, or I turn the screen to create more advance-able perspectives.</p>  <p>There are welcome differences and additions from the last outing. Monument Valley featured a single princess. But Ro isn't the only playable character this time around. She is joined by a small child, her daughter. Some of the puzzles require that mother and daughter work together in order to progress. I move them separately onto trigger buttons where they set-off openings for one another. I like them both for who they are and for what they do for one another.</p>
      <p class = "card-text"> The sequel-ness of the game is compromised by a timidity to push its possibilities into unexplored areas of the imagination. Just at the point when the game teaches you its exotic language, it flits away. There's a lack of commitment to its own shining soul. A part of me — cynical and such — wonders when the DLC levels will drop and if they are already well on the way to being made.</p>

      <h3 class="card-title">TELLING LIES REVIEW:</h3>
      <h5>"SAM BARLOW HAS ANOTHER MASTERPIECE ON HIS HANDS"</h5>
      <p class = "card-text">It all starts with love. A woman called Karen logs into her computer, plugs in a hard drive filled with illicitly obtained videos recorded on webcams and smartphone cameras, as well as the documentation explaining how best to access them all. 'Love' sits there in the search bar. It has conjured up a selection of five videos, and I'm warned that the search has been limited to that specific figure. Thumbnails show different faces and locations, teasing a multitude of theories and questions, and it's all too easy to dive straight in. Instantly, you're trying to fathom who these people are, how they're connected, and what the heck is going on here.</p>
      <p class = "card-text">It's a game that stays with you, and through the medium of its storytelling manages to make you as much a part of the voyeuristic, privacy-invading problem as the entire game tries to take apart. I'm still thinking about Telling Lies, and will be for years to come. Or at least, every time I walk past a security camera, or make a voice call.</p>
