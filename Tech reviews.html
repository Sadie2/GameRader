      <h5>Brighter display, longer battery life and powerful cameras.</h5>
      <p class="card-text">The iPhone 13 doesn’t bring with it a huge number of new features, but it does improve on the iPhone 12 in several areas – chiefly battery life, power, display and cameras – to make this one of the most impressive all-round handsets we’ve seen from Apple. </p>

      <h3 class="card-title">Samsung Galaxy S22:</h3>
      <h5>Small and refined</h5>
      <p class="card-text">The S22's headline 6.1-inch screen isn't dramatically smaller than the 6.2-inch panel in the one-year-older S21. But it's enough, complete with its rounded corners, to present a phone that both looks and feels even smaller than that. The S22+ is 6.6-inches, the S22 Ultra even larger at 6.8-inches. Interestingly it's only the latter of those which opts for a curved edge display (not to mention integrated S Pen stylus), whereas the S22 is all about its flat front.  The charging speed is also reduced to 25W, so is less impressive than the Plus or Ultra variants' 45W. Fortunately there's still wireless charging available here, if you prefer to skip the wires altogether.

Fortunately there's still wireless charging available here, if you prefer to skip the wires altogether.  That said, with the S21 Fan Edition barely a month old and delivering many of these features for less cash, all in a 6.4-inch device, there's certainly question marks surrounding Samsung's launch calendar of late.</p>

      <h3 class="card-title"> Xbox Series X:</h3>
      <h5>Microsofts Xbox Series X is undeniably fast – but lacks the wow factor</h5>
      <p class="card-text">The Xbox Series X utilizes its powerful specs to significantly reduce load times and boost overall game performance and visual fidelity. But while features such as Quick Resume, Smart Delivery and backward compatibility give it that extra edge, it’s hard to deny that it’s lacking in key areas – notably, significant UI improvements and captivating exclusive games.</p>

      <h5>The PS5 continues to impress with its revolutionary controller, blazing-fast load times and exclusive games</h5>
      <p class="card-text">The PS5 is a powerful and well-designed console that offers a compelling next-gen gaming experience. Its library of exclusive games continues to be a showcase for the PS5’s marvelous DualSense controller, spatial 3D audio tech, and super-fast SSD, and it’s the reason why so many gamers will covet Sony’s new PlayStation console. It might be too big for some setups, though, and a couple of issues hold it back from being a five-star product. However, it's a welcome upgrade over the PS4 and an exciting portal to next-gen gameplay.</p>

      <h3 class="card-title">Nintendo Switch review:</h3>
      <h5>The Nintendo Switch is still a big winner over two years later.</h5>
      <p class="card-text">The Nintendo Switch is a fantastic console for all kinds of gamers, even if you're not a Nintendo fan.This could have been a tough time for Nintendo, given that Sony and Microsoft have just released their next-gen PS5 and Xbox Series X consoles. But with runaway successes like Animal Crossing: New Horizons, remasterings of classic games such as the recently released Super Mario 3D All-Stars, an increasing number of third-party games from developers big and small, as well as completely unique experiences like Nintendo Labo or Mario Kart Live, it feels like the Switch won't be in trouble as Sony and Microsoft transition from one console generation to the next.</p>
