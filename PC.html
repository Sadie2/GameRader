        <h3 class="card-title">Nobody Saves the World Review:</h3>
        <h5>This isn't even my final form!</h5>
        <p class="card-text">How much I enjoyed Nobody Saves the World was constantly in flux as I played, which is somewhat appropriate given the transforming nature of its hero. Nobody Saves the World’s straightforward story opens with the onset of a disastrous calamity: everything has inexplicably been covered in gross fungus, monsters are everywhere, and the world’s most powerful wizard, Nostramagus, has gone missing. It’s up to you, a pale-bodied amnesiac named Nobody armed with Nostramagus’ magic wand, to – as the title would suggest – save the world. It’s serviceable as an excuse to send you all across the overworld, clearing out dungeons and collecting shards of a magical gem as you go. Platfrom: Xbox one, Xbox series X/S and PC. </p>

        <h3 class="card-title">Life is Strange: True Colors Review:</h3>
        <h5>Deck Nine’s third Life is Strange game is the best in the series.</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Life is Strange: True Colors has kept me more emotionally invested than any Life is Strange story since I played the original back in 2015. While every game in this adventure series is good in its own way, this one (from developer Deck Nine as opposed to the series’ creators at Dontnod) addresses many consistent issues that have plagued the last three games. It proves to be the best in the series thanks to consistent writing for both main and side characters, a compelling mystery story with good pacing, useful supernatural abilities, and perhaps most importantly, dialogue choices that offer more depth and complexity with big and most small decisions that actually impact the story in meaningful ways throughout the course of five chapters. While you can certainly play each chapter in bits and pieces, they’re all available immediately so you can binge its 14 hours of story in one sitting with no waiting.</p>  <p>Every episode has good pacing, a clear goal, and plenty of suspense. Life is Strange: True Colors is a fantastic game that offers a great story with solid pacing, and unlike previous games in the series it left me with the feeling that every choice I made mattered. In picking up where Dontnod left off, Deck Nine has gone above and beyond to create the best game in the series to date and I am excited to see what the studio does with it next. Platforms: PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox series X/S, Pc and Google Stadia.</p>

        <h3 class="card-title">OlliOlli World Review:</h3>
        <h5>"SAM BARLOW HAS ANOTHER MASTERPIECE ON HIS HANDS"</h5>
        <p class = "card-text">Welcome to Olliwood, was a breath of fresh air for the skating genre. Its stylised art, intense level design, and challenging trick system all helped it stand out. Seven years later, OlliOlli World has all those things going for it, too, but it also takes a huge step forward for the series by shifting into 3D, giving its skating a better sense of scale, speed, and dynamism without sacrificing the 2D perspective. At the same time, it builds significantly on Olliwood's technical gameplay by layering grabs, wall rides, and more atop the flip tricks, grinds, and manuals that were its foundation. And on top of all that, it goes out of its way to be more welcoming to players of all stripes, putting forth a host of changes that ensure just about anyone can have a good time without losing the fiercely high skill ceiling the series is known for.  OlliOlli World is a fantastic evolution of what was already an outstanding skating series. Platforms: PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Switch.</p>
